# üìë Full Stack Interview Notes (React + Laravel + MySQL + DevOps)

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Computer Science (FANG Expectation)

* **DSA (must for coding rounds)**

  * Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks/Queues, Trees, Graphs.
  * Algorithms: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, DP (Knapsack, LIS), Sorting & Searching.
  * Complexity: Big-O for time & space.

* **System Design (high-level + low-level)**

  * REST vs GraphQL APIs.
  * Scalability: Load balancers, caching, microservices.
  * Database design (SQL vs NoSQL trade-offs).
  * Real-world cases: **Design Instagram, WhatsApp, eCommerce, Insurance Platform**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Laravel (Backend)

* **Architecture**

  * MVC flow, Service Container, Service Provider, Dependency Injection.
  * Middleware (auth, rate limiting, role-based).
  * Events, Jobs, Queues, Listeners.

* **DB Layer**

  * Eloquent relationships (1:1, 1\:M, M\:M, polymorphic).
  * N+1 problem ‚Üí fix with `with()`.
  * Transactions & isolation levels.
  * DB read/write splitting.

* **Performance & Scaling**

  * Octane (Swoole/RoadRunner).
  * Redis for caching + queues.
  * API rate limiting (`throttle` middleware).
  * Horizon for queue management.

* **Security**

  * CSRF, XSS, SQL injection prevention.
  * Encryption/Hashing (`bcrypt`, `argon2`).
  * API authentication (JWT, Laravel Passport, Sanctum).

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ React (Frontend)

* **Core Concepts**

  * Virtual DOM, Reconciliation, Keys.
  * State & Props, Context API.
  * Controlled vs Uncontrolled components.

* **Advanced**

  * Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useReducer`).
  * Custom hooks for reusability.
  * React Router (SPA, dynamic routes, nested routes).
  * State management: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Recoil.

* **Performance**

  * Memoization (`React.memo`).
  * Code splitting, lazy loading, Suspense.
  * Avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

* **Testing**

  * Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (E2E).

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ MySQL / Database

* **Schema Design**

  * Normalization vs denormalization.
  * Indexing (B-tree, covering indexes).
  * Partitioning & sharding basics.

* **Queries**

  * Joins, subqueries, CTEs.
  * Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`).
  * Optimizing queries with `EXPLAIN`.

* **Transactions & Locks**

  * ACID, isolation levels.
  * Deadlock detection.

* **Scaling**

  * Read replicas, master-slave replication.
  * Using caching layers.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ DevOps + Cloud (for FANG-level rounds)

* **Docker**

  * Multi-stage builds for Laravel/React.
  * Docker Compose (multi-service setup).
  * Networking & volumes.

* **CI/CD**

  * GitHub Actions / GitLab CI pipelines.
  * Deploy React + Laravel in Docker.
  * Rolling updates / blue-green deployments.

* **Infrastructure**

  * Nginx/Apache reverse proxy for Laravel/React.
  * AWS basics: EC2, RDS (MySQL), S3 (file storage), CloudFront.
  * Kubernetes/Swarm (container orchestration).

* **Monitoring & Logging**

  * Prometheus + Grafana.
  * ELK stack / Loki.

* **Security/Best Practices**

  * Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
  * SSL/TLS, HTTPS everywhere.
  * Zero-downtime deployments.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Sample Interview Qs (Full Stack)

### React

* How does React‚Äôs reconciliation algorithm work?
* Difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?
* How would you optimize a large list rendering in React?

### Laravel

* Explain the Service Container.
* How would you scale a Laravel API to handle 1M requests/day?
* What are Laravel‚Äôs broadcasting & events?

### MySQL

* How would you design the DB schema for Facebook ‚Äúfriends‚Äù?
* Explain index types in MySQL.
* Difference between `INNER JOIN` vs `LEFT JOIN`.

### DevOps

* Explain zero-downtime deployment strategy.
* Difference between Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes.
* How to scale Laravel horizontally with Docker?

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Mock System Design Case

**Design an Insurance Claim Platform (like Instasure)**

* Users ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Claims ‚Üí Brokers.
* Real-time claim status updates (Laravel events + Redis + WebSockets).
* DB: Sharded MySQL with read replicas.
* React frontend for dashboards + claims.
* API Gateway (Laravel) behind Nginx + load balancer.
* CI/CD pipeline for automated deploys.
* Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana.

---

‚úÖ **Pro Tips for FANG**

* Be clear about trade-offs (SQL vs NoSQL, monolith vs microservices).
* Explain **why** you choose an architecture, not just **how**.
* Practice live coding + whiteboard (LeetCode + System Design).
* For behavioral: **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
