### Full-Stack Engineer Interview Notes: Short Answers with Key Points

Based on your CV (Md. Ashraful Momen) and the specified stack (React, Laravel, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Nginx, Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Kali Linux), here are concise answers tailored to your experience as of 03:50 PM +06, October 08, 2025.

#### Part 1: General Background & Experience

1. **Could you walk us through your most recent projects?**
   - **Answer**: At Instasure Limited (Jan 2023-Present), I led a microservices architecture for 40M+ users with Laravel, React, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Nginx, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes, integrating Robi APIs and 100+ hospitals. I optimized performance by 40% with Redis caching and mentored juniors. Earlier, at Decodes Lab (Apr-Dec 2022), I built Django/React apps with RabbitMQ and Redis for async workflows.
   - **Key Points**: Highlight scale (40M+), tech stack, leadership, optimization (Redis/MySQL), and mentorship.

2. **What are two things you like and don’t like about Laravel?**
   - **Answer**: I like Eloquent for MySQL ease and RabbitMQ queue integration for real-time features. I dislike its opinionated structure in Kubernetes setups and performance overhead, mitigated with Redis/Nginx.
   - **Key Points**: Likes - ORM, queues; Dislikes - rigidity, overhead; Mitigations - caching, tuning.

3. **Do you prefer raw SQL or ORM (Eloquent)? Why?**
   - **Answer**: I prefer Eloquent for MySQL security and scalability (e.g., Instasure’s sharding), but use raw SQL via DB facade for optimized joins in high-traffic areas.
   - **Key Points**: ORM - security, scalability; Raw SQL - performance; Hybrid approach.

4. **What editor/IDE do you use, and do you leverage AI tools?**
   - **Answer**: I use VS Code with Laravel/React extensions. I leverage GitHub Copilot for Laravel/RabbitMQ code, boosting productivity by 20-30%, reviewed for Kali Linux security checks.
   - **Key Points**: VS Code (extensible), AI for productivity, security review.

5. **What are common security risks, and how would you secure a public API?**
   - **Answer**: Risks include SQL injection and XSS. I’d secure with Laravel JWT, Nginx rate limiting, Redis token blacklisting, and Kali Linux penetration testing, monitored by Prometheus/Loki.
   - **Key Points**: Risks - injection, XSS; Security - auth, rate limiting, testing.

6. **Explain authentication vs. authorization.**
   - **Answer**: Authentication verifies identity (Laravel JWT with Redis), authorization checks permissions (Gates in microservices via RabbitMQ).
   - **Key Points**: Auth - identity; Authz - access; Framework integration.

7. **What’s your experience with automated testing?**
   - **Answer**: I use PHPUnit for Laravel/MySQL and Jest for React, writing unit, integration, and E2E tests, integrated into GitLab CI/CD at Instasure.
   - **Key Points**: Frameworks - PHPUnit/Jest; Types - unit, E2E; CI/CD integration.

#### Part 2: Scenario-Based System Design

##### Scenario 1 – Handling Real-Time Webhook Overload
1. **Redesign architecture?**
   - **Answer**: Use Nginx to queue webhooks into RabbitMQ, process with Laravel workers scaled via Kubernetes, monitored by Grafana/Prometheus.
   - **Key Points**: Queues, scaling, monitoring.

2. **Queuing/concurrency strategies?**
   - **Answer**: RabbitMQ with acks, Laravel workers in parallel, orchestrated in Kubernetes.
   - **Key Points**: Durable queues, concurrency.

3. **Error retries and resiliency?**
   - **Answer**: Exponential backoff in RabbitMQ, dead-letter queues, health checks in Kubernetes, logged in Loki.
   - **Key Points**: Retries, resiliency, logging.

4. **Prioritize urgent vs. low-priority jobs?**
   - **Answer**: RabbitMQ priority queues (e.g., email high, video low), managed via Laravel.
   - **Key Points**: Priority queues, balance.

##### Scenario 2 – Abuse Detection & Rate Limiting
1. **Where to enforce rate limits?**
   - **Answer**: Nginx gateway, Laravel middleware, Redis tracking.
   - **Key Points**: Multi-layer, efficient.

2. **Redis or PostgreSQL for request patterns?**
   - **Answer**: Redis for speed and INCR, as used in Instasure caching.
   - **Key Points**: Speed, scalability.

3. **Surface abuse signals?**
   - **Answer**: Log to Loki, publish via RabbitMQ, alert via Grafana.
   - **Key Points**: Logging, events, alerts.

##### Scenario 3 – Respecting Strict Third-Party Rate Limits
1. **Design queuing system?**
   - **Answer**: Redis token bucket, RabbitMQ queue, Laravel Scheduler at 30/min.
   - **Key Points**: Rate limiting, scheduling.

2. **Prevent overflow?**
   - **Answer**: Nginx 429, RabbitMQ limits, monitored by Prometheus.
   - **Key Points**: Backpressure, monitoring.

3. **Retry failed jobs?**
   - **Answer**: Backoff with jitter in RabbitMQ, separate retry queues.
   - **Key Points**: Intelligent retries, limits.

4. **Design progress bar?**
   - **Answer**: React with Laravel Echo (Redis), ETA from queue position.
   - **Key Points**: Real-time, UX.

5. **Queue engines in cloud?**
   - **Answer**: RabbitMQ, Laravel Queue, Kubernetes CronJobs.
   - **Key Points**: Engine, orchestration.

##### Scenario 4 – Scalable Image Search
1. **Databases/search engines?**
   - **Answer**: MySQL with sharding for metadata, Elasticsearch for search.
   - **Key Points**: Sharding, indexing.

2. **Handle caching?**
   - **Answer**: Redis for hot queries, invalidate via RabbitMQ.
   - **Key Points**: Caching, invalidation.

3. **Indexing/sharding strategies?**
   - **Answer**: MySQL sharding, Kubernetes distribution, <100ms latency.
   - **Key Points**: Sharding, latency.

4. **Evaluate trade-offs?**
   - **Answer**: Cost (MySQL vs. Elasticsearch), latency, scalability, POC benchmarks.
   - **Key Points**: Cost, performance, testing.
