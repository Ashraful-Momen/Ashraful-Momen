# üöÄ Scenario 4 ‚Äî Scalable Image Search (10M+ images)

Users need **fast keyword + visual-similarity search** and you must keep costs reasonable.

---

### 1) Which systems to use for metadata and vector search

**Recommended combo:**

* **Metadata (titles, tags, filters):** **Postgres** (or DynamoDB)

  * Good for relational queries, filters, and transactions.
  * Cheap and reliable for storing image records, owners, timestamps, ACLs.
* **Vector / visual search:** **Specialized vector DB** (managed or self-hosted) ‚Äî **Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, or FAISS** (via Milvus).

  * Built for ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) search at scale and low latency.
* **Full-text / hybrid search (optional):** **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch** or **Algolia** for very fast keyword search and faceting.

  * Or use hybrid search where vector DB returns candidates and ES ranks with keyword signals.

**Short reason:** Use each tool for what it‚Äôs best at ‚Äî Postgres for structured data, vector DB for embeddings, search engine for rich keyword features.

---

### 2) How to cache frequent queries while still supporting rare searches

**Key points**

* **CDN + edge caching:** Cache search pages/thumbnail results for popular queries (CloudFront, Fastly). Good for repeat GETs.
* **Result-cache (Redis):** Cache query ‚Üí top-k result IDs for hot queries (small TTL like 30s‚Äì5m). Store final result lists, not full images.
* **Materialized views / precompute:** For very common filters (e.g., ‚Äútop trending‚Äù), precompute and refresh periodically.
* **Hybrid approach:** Cache vector-search *IDs* and then fetch metadata from Postgres; avoids repeated vector queries.
* **Fallback for rare queries:** If no cache hit, query vector DB + search engine; rare queries cost more but are uncommon.

**In short:** Cache hot results (CDN + Redis + precompute). Let cold queries go to the full pipeline.

---

### 3) Indexing, sharding, and distributed strategies to keep latency low

**Key points**

* **ANN index type:** Use HNSW or IVF+PQ (provided by Milvus, FAISS, Pinecone) ‚Äî HNSW is low-latency for many workloads.
* **Sharding / partitioning:**

  * **Horizontal shards** by image_id range, tenant, or creation date to split load.
  * Use **replicas** for read scale and redundancy.
* **Quantization & compression:** Use PQ/OPQ to reduce memory and speed up search (saves cost).
* **Index per-popularity tier:** Keep high-activity images in an in-memory index; cold images in slower storage.
* **Routing & locality:** Route similar queries to specific partitions (vector clustering) to reduce cross-shard costs.
* **Autoscaling:** Scale vector nodes based on query QPS and CPU / memory; keep a small warm pool for fast burst handling.
* **Batching & asynchronous ranking:** Do ANN to get candidates quickly, then run final re-ranking (keyword scoring, business rules) in a second fast step.

**In short:** Use ANN indexes (HNSW/IVF), shard and replicate, compress vectors, and separate hot vs cold data.

### 4) How to evaluate trade-offs (Elasticsearch, Algolia, Pinecone, Postgres)

**Evaluation checklist (keep it simple):**

* **Latency:** p99/p50 response times under your SLA.
* **Accuracy:** recall / precision of similar-image results and combined keyword+vector relevance.
* **Cost:** hosted vs self-hosted, memory needs for vectors, network egress, operational staff cost.
* **Scalability:** how easily it grows from 10M ‚Üí 100M images.
* **Features:** hybrid search, faceting, vector support, re-ranking, multi-vector, metadata filtering.
* **Operational complexity:** managed service reduces ops effort; self-hosting gives control but costs engineering time.
* **Ecosystem & tooling:** connectors, client libraries, monitoring, backup, reindexing ease.

**Quick comparison (very short):**

* **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch**

  * * Great for text, facets, integrated stack
  * ‚àí Vector support exists but not as optimized as vector DBs; memory heavy at scale
* **Algolia**

  * * Extremely fast keyword search & UX features
  * ‚àí Expensive at large scale; not focused on vector similarity
* **Pinecone / Milvus / Weaviate**

  * * Built for vectors, low-latency ANN, optimized memory/indexing
  * ‚àí Pinecone is managed (less ops); Milvus self-hosted gives control; cost varies
* **Postgres (with pgvector)**

  * * Cheap, transactional metadata + small vector use
  * ‚àí Not ideal for 10M+ vector-scale low-latency searches unless heavily tuned & big RAM

**Decision rule:** If you want fastest time-to-market and low ops: **managed Pinecone + Postgres + CDN**. If you want control and lower recurring costs at scale: **Milvus (self-host) or FAISS on k8s + Elastic for text**.

---

### 5) Quick architecture suggestion (balanced & cost-aware)

* **Postgres** for metadata and business queries.
* **Vector DB (Pinecone or Milvus)** for ANN similarity (store embeddings).
* **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch** only if you need rich keyword faceting / near-instant indexing; otherwise rely on Postgres full-text + vector hybrid ranking.
* **Redis + CDN** for caching hot query results and thumbnails.
* **Autoscaled worker nodes** to ingest images, compute embeddings (batch or streaming), and update indexes.
* **Monitoring:** track QPS, p50/p99 latency, index memory, cold vs hot hit rates.

---

### ‚úÖ Short Summary (one-liner)

Use **Postgres** for metadata + a **vector DB** (Pinecone/Milvus/Weaviate) for visual similarity, add **Elasticsearch** only if you need advanced keyword features, cache hot results with **CDN + Redis**, and use ANN indexes + sharding/replicas to keep latency low while balancing cost vs ops effort.
