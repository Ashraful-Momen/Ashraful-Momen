Here’s a **fast, step-by-step checklist** you can confidently say in an interview in under 30 seconds when asked “What would you do if my React + Laravel app slows down?”

### **React + Laravel Performance Troubleshooting Checklist**

**1️⃣ Identify the Bottleneck**

* Check if slowness is **frontend, backend, or database**.
* Use browser DevTools, API logs, and Laravel profiler.

**2️⃣ Frontend (React)**

* Optimize **rendering**: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`.
* **Code splitting & lazy loading** for large bundles.
* Avoid **excessive API calls** → debounce, cache.

**3️⃣ Backend (Laravel)**

* Profile endpoints for slow responses.
* Fix **N+1 queries** and optimize database queries.
* Use **caching** (Redis/Memcached) for repeated data.
* Move long tasks to **queues** (RabbitMQ, Laravel queues).

**4️⃣ Database**

* Add missing **indexes**.
* Paginate large queries.
* Optimize queries → avoid `SELECT *`.

**5️⃣ Infrastructure & Scaling**

* Check **CPU, memory**, server load.
* Use **load balancer** for distribution.
* Enable **auto-scaling** if on cloud.

**6️⃣ Monitoring**

* Set up **Grafana / Prometheus** for metrics.
* Collect logs with **Loki / ELK** for debugging.

💡 **Tip for interview delivery:**
Say it like a story:

> “First, I’d identify the bottleneck, then check React for rendering or API issues, Laravel for slow queries or caching, database optimization, move heavy tasks to queues, and finally monitor infrastructure and metrics to prevent future slowdowns.”

If you want, I can also **combine this checklist with the ASCII diagram** into a single **one-page visual summary** that’s easy to show in interviews—it looks very professional.

Do you want me to do that?
