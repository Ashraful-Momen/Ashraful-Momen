# ðŸš§ Scenario 1 â€” Handling Real-Time Webhook Overload (1,500/min)

You get **1,500 webhooks per minute** from a video service. This causes delays and missed events. Below are simple, interview-ready answers.

---

## 1) How to redesign the architecture to handle spikes reliably

**Key idea:** Accept quickly, store safely, process later.

* **Fast ACK:** Return `200 OK` immediately to the webhook sender.
* **Durable queue:** Put each event into a queue (Kafka, SQS, RabbitMQ, or Redis Streams).
* **Async workers:** Separate worker processes read the queue and do the heavy work.
* **Idempotency:** Save event IDs so you donâ€™t process the same event twice.
* **Backpressure:** If queue is full, reply `429/503` so sender can retry later.

**Why:** Keeps the webhook endpoint fast and lets processing scale independently.

## 2) Which queuing & concurrency strategies to use

**Key idea:** Use a durable queue + autoscaled worker pools.

* **Queue choice:** Kafka for high throughput; SQS/Rabbit for simple setup; Redis Streams for small/medium.
* **Worker pools:** Scale workers automatically (Kubernetes HPA, ECS autoscale).
* **Partitioning:** Split work by `video_id` or tenant to parallelize safely.
* **Limit in-flight tasks:** Set prefetch/concurrency limits to avoid overload.
* **Batching & rate-limited consumers:** Batch small jobs and limit calls to downstream services.

**Why:** Keeps processing efficient and prevents resource exhaustion.

## 3) How to handle retries and make the system resilient

**Key idea:** Retry smartly, isolate failures, and track bad messages.

* **Idempotent processing:** Make work safe to run more than once.
* **Exponential backoff + jitter:** Wait longer each retry (1s, 2s, 4s + random).
* **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ):** After N retries (e.g., 5), move to DLQ for manual fix.
* **Circuit breaker & bulkheads:** Pause or isolate failing parts so others continue.
* **Monitoring & tracing:** Watch DLQ size, retry spikes, latency; include request IDs.
* **Replay support:** Use Kafka or stored events to re-run after fixing issues.

**Why:** Prevents retry storms and makes failures visible and recoverable.

## 4) How to prioritize urgent vs low-priority jobs

**Key idea:** Keep urgent work in separate, reserved lanes.

* **Separate queues (best):** `high_priority` (password resets), `normal`, `low_priority` (video).
* **Dedicated workers:** Reserve some workers just for `high_priority` so they always run.
* **Priority scheduling:** Or use priority queues / weighted consumers to pull high first.
* **Preemption:** Pause low-priority processing when system is overloaded.
* **SLA tracking:** Monitor p99 latency for high-priority tasks.

**Why:** Ensures critical tasks finish quickly even during spikes.

## âœ… One-line summary

Acknowledge webhooks fast, enqueue events to a durable queue, process with autoscaled worker pools, retry with exponential backoff + DLQ, and use separate queues so urgent jobs always win.
