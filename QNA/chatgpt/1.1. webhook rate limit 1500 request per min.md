# ðŸš§ Scenario 1 â€” Handling Real-Time Webhook Overload (1,500/min)

---

## 1) Architecture â€” keep webhooks fast and async

* **Fast ACK:** Reply `200 OK` immediately to the webhook.
* **Durable queue:** Push the event to a queue (Kafka, SQS, Rabbit, or Redis Streams).
* **Async workers:** Separate workers read the queue and do heavy work.
* **Store IDs:** Save event ID in DB/cache for dedupe and replay.
* **Backpressure:** If queue is full, return `429/503` so the sender can retry.

**Why:** avoids timeouts and lets you scale processing separately.

---

## 2) Queuing & concurrency

* **Use a durable queue** (Kafka for high throughput; SQS/Rabbit for simple queues; Redis Streams for small-medium).
* **Worker pools:** Autoscale workers (k8s/ECS) to match load.
* **Partitioning:** Split by `video_id` or tenant to parallelize safely.
* **Limit in-flight tasks:** Use prefetch limits to avoid OOM or downstream throttling.
* **Batching & rate-limit consumers** where safe to reduce overhead.

**Why:** keeps processing efficient and safe under spikes.

---

## 3) Error retries & resiliency

* **Idempotent tasks** so retries are safe.
* **Exponential backoff + jitter** (1s, 2s, 4s + random) for retries.
* **Dead-letter queue (DLQ)** after max attempts (e.g., 5) for manual review.
* **Circuit breaker & bulkheads:** isolate failing parts so others keep working.
* **Monitoring & tracing:** alert on DLQ growth, retry spikes, worker failures.
* **Replayable data:** Kafka or durable store lets you replay after fixes.

**Why:** prevents retry storms and makes failures visible.

---

## 4) Prioritization â€” urgent vs low-priority jobs

* **Separate queues (best):** `high`, `normal`, `low`. Reserve workers for `high`.
* **Priority queues / weighted consumers:** pull high first, give fixed CPU share.
* **Preemption & quotas:** pause low-priority if overloaded; always keep N workers for high.
* **Track SLAs:** monitor p99 for high-priority tasks.

**Why:** ensures critical tasks (password reset) finish fast.

---

## 5) Extra practical measures

* **Idempotency keys** and Redis TTL for dedupe.
* **Backpressure to sender** (429/503) if overloaded.
* **Autoscale workers** (HPA / KEDA) for peaks.
* **Graceful degradation:** delay or reduce non-essential work (video quality).
* **Dashboards:** queue depth, consumer lag, retry counts, DLQ size.
* **Load & chaos tests** to validate.

**Why:** better reliability, visibility, and recovery.

## 6) Minimal example flow

1. Webhook â†’ HTTP `200 OK` immediately + enqueue to `video-events`.
2. Small validator worker stores metadata and enqueues processing job.
3. Video worker pulls job, calls ML, saves result; on failure â†’ retry â†’ DLQ if exhausted.
4. Password reset jobs go to `high_priority` queue with reserved workers.

---

## âœ… Quick one-line summary

Acknowledge webhooks fast, enqueue events to a durable queue, process with autoscaled isolated workers, use exponential backoff + DLQ for retries, and keep urgent jobs in separate queues so they always win.
