## 🚨 Scenario 2: Abuse Detection & Rate Limiting

A public API that gives ML-powered recommendations is being abused — some clients are sending hundreds of requests every second.

---

### **1️⃣ Where to enforce rate limits?**

✅ **At the API Gateway**

**Key Points:**

* API Gateway (like **NGINX, Kong, or Traefik**) is the **best place** to stop abuse before it reaches your backend.
* It’s **fast** and can **block requests early** — saving CPU, memory, and ML model costs.
* Works well in **distributed systems**, because all traffic goes through it.

**Extra:**

* Middleware → use for user-level rules after login (extra protection).
* Database → **never for live rate limiting**, only for **logs or reports**.

**In short:**
👉 Stop requests at the **gateway** = fast, cheap, scalable.
👉 Middleware = backup layer.
👉 Database = only for history, not for blocking.

---

### **2️⃣ Which storage to use: Redis or PostgreSQL?**

✅ **Use Redis for rate tracking**
✅ **Use PostgreSQL for analysis later**

**Key Points:**

* **Redis** is super fast (keeps data in memory).
* Can **auto-expire** keys (using TTL) → perfect for “X requests per minute”.
* **Atomic operations** (`INCR`, `EXPIRE`) make counting requests easy and safe.
* Handles **millions of requests** with no slowdowns.

**Example:**

```
Key: rate:user123:202510151320
Value: 56
TTL: 60 seconds
```

If count > limit → block the user for that time window.

**PostgreSQL:**
Use later for:

* Audit logs
* Reports
* ML analysis of abuse patterns

**In short:**
👉 **Redis = real-time counting & blocking**
👉 **PostgreSQL = data analysis & history**

---

### **3️⃣ How to share abuse signals with Engineering & ML teams**

**Goal:**
Both teams should **see abuse patterns quickly** and **use them to improve** the system or ML model.

#### 🔹 a) Engineering team

* **Real-time alerts:** Send warnings to Slack or PagerDuty when traffic spikes.
* **Dashboards:** Use Grafana or Datadog to see top abusive IPs, users, or APIs.
* **Auto-actions:** Block or slow down suspicious users temporarily.

#### 🔹 b) ML team

* **Save logs:** Keep examples of abusive requests (time, IP, user, pattern).
* **Label data:** Mark good vs bad requests for future model training.
* **Retrain ML models:** Use new data to improve spam/fraud detection.

#### 🔹 c) Shared tools

* Use **Kafka or Redis Streams** to send request data to both teams.
* Store in **PostgreSQL / S3** for long-term use.
* Create **shared Grafana dashboards** so everyone sees the same data.

**In short:**
👉 Engineering = stop and monitor abuse in real time.
👉 ML = learn from abuse to make smarter detection.
👉 Both share data through a common event system.

### ✅ **Quick Summary (Easy to Remember)**

| Step                     | Best Choice                | Why                                     |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Rate limit location**  | **API Gateway**            | Stops abuse early, efficient, scalable  |
| **Storage for counters** | **Redis**                  | Fast, supports TTL, great for real-time |
| **Database use**         | **PostgreSQL**             | For logs, audit, and ML data            |
| **Abuse reporting**      | **Dashboards + Alerts**    | Engineers fix quickly                   |
| **ML improvement**       | **Use labeled abuse data** | Smarter models next time                |

---

**Simple answer in one line:**

> I’ll enforce rate limits at the **API Gateway**, store counters in **Redis** for real-time tracking, send logs to **PostgreSQL** for analysis, and use **dashboards + alerts** so both the engineering and ML teams can learn and improve from abuse patterns.
