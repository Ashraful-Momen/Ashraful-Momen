# ðŸš§ Scenario 1 â€” Handling Real-Time Webhook Overload

You get **1,500 webhook calls / minute** from a 3rd-party ML video service. This overloads your system and causes delays and missed events. Hereâ€™s how to redesign and handle it reliably.

---

## 1) Architecture redesign â€” keep webhooks fast, durable, and async

**Key idea:** Acknowledge webhooks immediately, persist the event, then process it asynchronously.

**Short steps:**

* **Webhook endpoint â†’ HTTP 200 (fast ACK).** Donâ€™t do heavy work in the HTTP handler.
* **Write event to durable buffer** (append-only): a message queue or log (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS + SNS, or Redis Streams).
* **Workers consume from queue** to process events (video post-processing, notifications, DB updates).
* **Persistent store for replay / dedupe:** store event id + payload in DB or cache to support idempotency and replay.
* **Backpressure & rate-limits:** if queue is full, reply with 429 or temporary 503 (or use exponential backoff header if provider supports it).

**Why this works:** Immediate ACK avoids webhook timeouts and lets processing scale independently.

---

## 2) Queuing & concurrency strategies

**Choose a durable queue + worker pool pattern.** Options:

* **Kafka**: high throughput, durable ordered log, good for replay and partitioning.
* **RabbitMQ** or **SQS**: simple work-queue semantics, easy to integrate.
* **Redis Streams**: lightweight, good for small-medium scale.

**Concurrency patterns:**

* **Worker pools** with autoscaling (k8s deployments, ECS autoscaling) â€” tune number of workers by CPU/memory and processing latency.
* **Partitioning / sharding:** partition by video_id or tenant to avoid hotspots and allow parallelism.
* **Prefetch / concurrency limits:** limit number of in-flight tasks per worker to avoid OOM or 3rd-party throttling.
* **Batching:** group small work items into a batch for efficient DB or downstream calls (if safe).
* **Rate-limited consumers:** apply token-bucket so downstream services (or your ML calls) arenâ€™t overwhelmed.

**Short example:** Kafka topic with N partitions â†’ consumer group of M workers; scale consumers to match throughput.

## 3) Error retries and resiliency

**Principles:** Exponential backoff, jitter, idempotency, dead-lettering, observability.

**Short rules:**

* **At-least-once processing** by default; make tasks idempotent.
* **Retries:** Use **exponential backoff + jitter** (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s + random jitter).
* **Max attempts â†’ DLQ:** After N attempts (e.g., 5), move message to **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)** for manual review or automated remediation.
* **Circuit breaker:** If downstream ML service is failing, trip a circuit breaker to pause jobs and avoid repeated failures.
* **Bulkhead isolation:** Run risky or heavy processing in isolated worker pools so other processing continues.
* **Monitoring & alerts:** Alert on rising DLQ size, retry rates, worker failures, and processing latency.
* **Replay support:** With Kafka or durable store, you can replay DLQ or original topic after fixes.
* **Visibility & tracing:** Include request IDs, event IDs, and traces (OpenTelemetry) for forensic debugging.

**Why:** Avoid thundering retries and ensure problematic messages are visible and fixable.

## 4) Prioritization: urgent jobs vs low-priority jobs

**Goal:** Ensure urgent jobs (password reset emails) beat heavy jobs (video gen).

**Strategies (simple â†’ more advanced):**

1. **Separate queues (recommended):**

   * `high_priority_queue` (password resets, login emails)
   * `normal_queue` (regular events)
   * `low_priority_queue` (video generation, heavy tasks)
   * Run dedicated worker pools for each queue with independent scaling and resources.

2. **Priority queue / weighted consumers:**

   * Use a priority-capable broker (RabbitMQ with priority queue, Redis sorted sets) or a scheduler that pulls from high â†’ normal â†’ low (strict draining).
   * Implement **weighted scheduling** to give X% CPU to high-priority tasks.

3. **Preemption & quotas:**

   * If system is overloaded, **pause** consuming low-priority queues or scale down their workers.
   * Reserve a fixed portion of resources for high-priority queue (e.g., always keep N workers for high queue).

4. **Timeouts & SLAs:**

   * Assign shorter timeouts / higher retries for urgent jobs so they complete faster.
   * Track SLA metrics separately (p99 latency for high-priority).

**In short:** Separate queues + dedicated workers is the easiest and safest.

## 5) Extra practical measures & graceful degradation

* **Idempotency keys:** Each webhook includes an event ID; skip duplicates if already processed.
* **Deduplication window:** Use a cache (Redis) keyed by event_id with TTL to prevent double-processing.
* **Backpressure to provider:** If queue is full, return 429/503 so provider can retry later (if supported).
* **On-demand scaling:** Autoscale workers during peaks (Kubernetes HPA / KEDA).
* **Graceful degradation:** When overloaded, degrade non-essential features (delay video processing, reduce quality) while keeping critical flows intact.
* **Visibility:** Dashboards for queue depth, processing rate, retry counts, DLQ size, consumer lag, mean latency.
* **Testing:** Run load tests and chaos experiments to validate behavior under spikes.

## 6) Short example flow (minimal)

1. Third-party posts webhook â†’ your HTTP handler `200 OK` immediately and enqueue event to `video-events` topic.
2. A small, fast worker validates and stores metadata to DB, then pushes to `video-processing` queue.
3. Video-processing worker pool pulls tasks at controlled concurrency, calls ML service, writes result. If fail â†’ retry with backoff â†’ move to DLQ after max attempts.
4. Password resets go to `high-priority` queue â€” always processed by a reserved worker pool with strict SLA.

---

## âœ… Quick Summary (one-liner)

Acknowledge webhooks fast, persist events to a durable queue, process with autoscaled and isolated worker pools, use exponential-backoff + DLQ for retries, and use separate priority queues (or priority scheduling) so urgent jobs always win.
