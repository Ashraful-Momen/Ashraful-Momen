Perfect üëç Based on your **current stack** ‚Äî React, Laravel, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Redis, Nginx, Docker, Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Kali Linux ‚Äî and your CV, here‚Äôs a **polished, interview-ready version** of your ‚ÄúSystem Engineering‚Äù answers:

---

## üß† **Part 1: General Background & Experience**

**Q: Could you walk us through your most recent projects? What tech stacks you worked with and your role/responsibilities?**
**A:**
In my current role as a **Senior Full Stack & DevOps Engineer** at Instasure Ltd, I designed and deployed a **microservice-based healthcare and insurance ecosystem** serving 40M+ users.
I worked with **Laravel (backend APIs)**, **React (frontend)**, **MySQL (database)**, **Redis (caching & queueing)**, **RabbitMQ (asynchronous messaging)**, and **Docker Swarm** for container orchestration.
I later migrated critical services to **Kubernetes**, implementing monitoring with **Prometheus, Grafana**, and centralized logging with **Loki + Nginx access logs**.
I handled system architecture, CI/CD automation, scaling, and performance optimization.

---

**Q: From your experience with Laravel, what are two things you like and two things you don‚Äôt like?**
**Likes:**

1. **Eloquent ORM** makes database interaction elegant and expressive.
2. **Built-in queue, cache, and broadcasting integrations** (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, Pusher) simplify building real-time and distributed systems.

**Dislikes:**

1. **Heavy framework footprint** ‚Äî performance can lag in high-load systems without optimization.
2. **Tight coupling** of some components makes microservice extraction more complex.

---

**Q: When working with databases, do you prefer raw SQL or ORM (Eloquent)? Why?**
**A:**
I primarily use **Eloquent ORM** for readability and maintainability, especially during rapid development.
However, for **high-performance analytics or batch jobs**, I prefer **raw SQL with indexes and optimized joins**, since I have strong SQL expertise (indexing, sharding, replication).

---

**Q: What editor/IDE do you use, and do you leverage any AI-assisted tools?**
**A:**
I use **VS Code** for both backend and frontend, and **PHPStorm** for deeper Laravel debugging.
I often leverage **GitHub Copilot** and **TabNine** to accelerate code writing, especially for repetitive boilerplate or test case generation.

---

**Q: Common security risks in web apps and how to secure a public API from the frontend?**
**A:**
Common risks include **SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass, and data leaks**.
To secure a public API:

* Use **JWT or OAuth 2.0** for token-based access.
* Implement **rate limiting via Redis**.
* Enforce **CORS rules** and **input sanitization**.
* Add **WAF rules via Nginx reverse proxy** and monitor logs via **Loki + Grafana dashboards**.

---

**Q: Difference between authentication and authorization?**
**A:**

* **Authentication** = verifying *who* the user is (login, tokens).
* **Authorization** = verifying *what* the user can do (role-based access, permissions).

---

**Q: What‚Äôs your experience with automated testing?**
**A:**
I use **PHPUnit** and **Pest** for Laravel unit and feature tests, **Jest** for React components, and **Postman/Newman** for API testing.
I focus on **unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E)** tests, integrated into CI/CD pipelines using **GitHub Actions** and **Docker test runners**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Part 2: Scenario-Based System Design**

### üß© Scenario 1 ‚Äì Handling Real-Time Webhook Overload

**Problem:** 1,500 webhook requests/min causing delay and missed events.

**Solution:**

* Use **Nginx load balancing** + **RabbitMQ** to queue incoming webhooks.
* Each webhook is **acknowledged instantly**, processed asynchronously by **Laravel workers** in **Docker Swarm/Kubernetes**.
* Use **Redis for rate control and deduplication**.
* **Prometheus + Grafana** to monitor queue depth and worker latency.

**Error retries:**

* Use **RabbitMQ DLX (Dead Letter Exchange)** or **Laravel Horizon retry jobs** with exponential backoff.

**Prioritization:**

* Define **separate queues** (high for password reset, low for video generation).
* Use **priority queues** in RabbitMQ to process urgent jobs first.

---

### üß© Scenario 2 ‚Äì Abuse Detection & Rate Limiting

**Where to enforce rate limits:**

* At **Nginx ingress controller** (first layer) and **Laravel middleware** for per-user control.

**Storage:**

* **Redis** ‚Äî ideal for storing request counters (fast in-memory).

**Abuse signals:**

* Log abnormal activity to **Prometheus metrics** and visualize alerts in **Grafana**.
* Forward detailed abuse logs to **Loki** for forensic analysis.

---

### üß© Scenario 3 ‚Äì Respecting Strict Third-Party Rate Limits

**Design:**

* Create an **internal Redis queue** that holds pending requests.
* A **scheduler (Laravel job or Kubernetes CronJob)** dequeues and calls the API at fixed intervals (‚â§30/min).
* Implement **retry with exponential backoff** using **RabbitMQ DLX**.
* Use **Redis counters** to prevent overflow or duplicate API calls.

**Progress Bar:**

* Use **WebSocket (Laravel Echo)** to broadcast job progress from backend to frontend.

**Engines/Tech:**

* **RabbitMQ, Laravel Horizon, Kubernetes CronJob** for scheduling and distributed control.

---

### üß© Scenario 4 ‚Äì Scalable Image Search (10M+ AI Images)

**Databases:**

* **PostgreSQL / MySQL** for metadata.
* **Elasticsearch or Pinecone** for vector similarity search.

**Caching:**

* **Redis cache layer** for frequent queries, fallback to DB for rare searches.

**Scaling Strategy:**

* **Sharding** metadata DB by user or category.
* Use **Elasticsearch index replication** for read-heavy traffic.
* Store images in **object storage (S3 compatible)** behind CDN.

**Evaluation:**

* **Elasticsearch**: cost-effective and self-hosted.
* **Pinecone**: better for high-dimensional vector embeddings but more costly.
* **Algolia**: great for keyword search, less suited for vector similarity.

## üíª **Part 3: Coding Challenge**

I‚Äôd clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/mtmsujon/unit-testing-task.git
cd unit-testing-task
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

Then I‚Äôd implement modular, testable code following SOLID and TDD ‚Äî writing unit tests for business logic and integration tests for API endpoints.
